I recently returned from a month-long solo trip to Canada. I visited:

- Toronto (3 days)
- Montreal (4 days)
- Quebec City (2 days)
- Halifax (1 ill-advised day)
- Vancouver (4 days)
- Banff (11 days)

It was hectic, but fun! I'm planning on compiling a YouTube video of my trip highlights; I might post it here later. Because I didn't have any friends with me on this trip, I spent a lot of time with my thoughts. Documenting some reflections here before I forget them all!

## Reflections on traveling

### Trip planning

// used to tell people that I liked to "play my vacations by ear", picturing myself as chill guy
I've never been much of a planner on vacations. I like to book the high-level logistics (flight, housing) ahead of time, but usually don't plan each day's activities until the morning of. For this trip, I tried an even more hands-off approach than normal; going into the trip, the only things I had booked were my flight to Toronto and lodging for a few nights.

The idea was this: I'd play it by ear and figure out where to go next when I felt "ready". If I liked a city, I'd stay in it longer! Conversely, if I felt an urge to escape civilization, I'd find a nice national park or small town and hole up there. Maximum flexibility, right?

Wrong. Instead of the optionality and freedom I had envisioned, I found myself cornered by rising plane ticket costs and haunted by the specter of needing to book logistics so I could relax... for a day before needing to book logistics again. In retrospect, it seems obvious; unless your budget is unlimited (mine was decidedly not), booking last-minute is usually a Bad Decision.

About a week into the trip, I realized the error of my ways, and ended up booking most of the rest of the trip in one night. As I figured out the hard way, what I really value in a trip is not flexibility or even fun -- rather, it's the freedom to not have to stress about things. And if a little more upfront planning than I thought enables that, then sign me up.

### Solo traveling

I was by myself for the entire trip, which was a new experience for me. Going in, I was pre
