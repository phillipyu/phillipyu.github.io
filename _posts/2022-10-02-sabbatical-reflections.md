NOTE: THIS IS AN OUTDATED DRAFT. CHECK OUT MY SUBSTACK INSTEAD!

I recently returned from a month-long trip to Canada, during which I visited five cities (Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Halifax, Vancouver, for a few days each) and one national park (Banff, for about 2 weeks). It was hectic, but fun! I'm considering compiling a highlight reel video of my trip; if so, I'll post it here later. 

In the meantime, here are some photos from the trip:


I traveled solo for the entire trip, so I spent a lot of time alone with my thoughts. I'm documenting a few unpolished reflections, ramblings, and realizations here.

## On taking up space

Christine, my partner, is uniquely gifted at understanding how the past affects the present [[http://isother.es/2022/10/22/daydreams.html]]. Much of her ability was borne out of the trauma she went through in her childhood; for her, drawing threads of causality from a feeling in the present to an experience in the past has been healing, by allowing her to gradually uninternalize the toxic shame common among survivors of complex PTSD [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder]. Absent significant childhood trauma, and absent a therapist (though Christine's been urging me to get one), I've generally had more trouble with [this] kind of introspection. On my sabbatical, though, aided by Christine and too much alone time, I drew some interesting connections.

One of these connections centers around my tendency to overly people-please. My reflections here were triggered by an interaction I had with an Airbnb host during my trip. I made my way to this particular bnb after a long day of traveling and was excited to kick back, relax, and turn on some mind-numbing reality TV. After arriving, my host (a very sweet elderly lady) showed me to my room, which was spacious, clean, and overall quite nice... except for the overwhelming acrylic smell emanating from the recently-renovated bathroom. My host apologized profusely, to which my immediate reaction was to assure her that oh, it was no problem at all, and that no, I couldn't really even smell it (I could). After she left, I then spent the next few minutes opening all the room's doors and windows to try and expunge the odor.

Why did I pretend like the smell didn't bother me, even though it did? Part of it was that the smell wasn't horrible at first (I was wearing a mask), and part of it was reluctance to deal with Yet Another Thing after a stressful day.* A major part of it, though, was that _I didn't want my host to feel bad because of me._

I constantly find myself prioritizing the comfort of others in this way, often even above my own needs. At work, I qualify mistakes I've found in other peoples' work with "I might have missed something" or "I might be misunderstanding". I have trouble asking mentors and teachers for references and recommendation letters, because I'm uncomfortable feeling like I'm burdening them. I feel strong, visceral discomfort whenever I think someone is angry at me. I bury criticism of others in compliments [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praise_sandwich].

During my sabbatical, I realized that I can trace the roots of my people-pleasing instincts back to southern suburbia, where I spent many of the formative years of my life. Some background: when I was around 4, my family moved from Toronto to Dallas, and then a couple years later to Plano, a neighboring suburb. In Toronto, we lived near Chinatown and were surrounded by people who looked like us; in Plano, I was the only East Asian in my predominantly white first-grade class. My school at first was unsure what to do with me; I remember being placed in ESL classes for the first few months until the teachers realized that English was, in fact, my primary language.

To be clear, I never experienced any overt signs of racism, especially compared to other Asians I know today who were explicitly picked on for their food or appearance. But I do think my race, and the accompanying cultural differences, were enough to set me apart from most of my peers, who were quick to outfit me with stereotypical labels: nice. shy. smart. quiet. nerdy.

At that age, the way your peers perceive you has an outsized effect on the way you perceive yourself, and in turn the way you develop. It didn't take long for me to internalize the labels I had been assigned, and I soon found myself shrinking myself in social situations in an effort to conform to my classmates' expectations. At the lunch table, I'd stay silent ("quiet") but keep a smile plastered on my face ("nice"). During recess, I'd sit on the sidelines of my friends' football games and watch ("nerdy"). In the classroom, even though I usually knew the answer, I'd rarely speak up ("shy"). 

Those principles of accommodation, agreeableness, and not taking up space continued to inform my behavior, even as I grew older and became more comfortable in social situations. I learned that people love to talk about themselves, that the best way to get someone to like you is to ask them a lot of questions, and to not share too much about myself lest others get bored. Along the way, I became adept at subduing and softening myself, in order to make others more comfortable.

As many are wont to do, I tend to look back at my childhood with rose-tinted glasses. It's interesting to realize that many of the aspects of myself I don't particularly like are rooted in experiences growing up that weren't so great.

For now, I'm working on asserting my own needs more, in my professional and my personal life. It doesn't always work, but I'm increasingly aware of the instances when I over-accommodate others, and I've become better at diagnosing what my own needs are. I think that's a step in the right direction. 

* This is a whole saga in its own right, but it includes me booking an Airbnb in "peaceful" Cape Breton, realizing I Fucked Up after the Airbnb host asked about my plans for the hurricane (what hurricane???), and then panic-flying across the country last-minute to escape Canada's worst storm in decades.


Parting thoughts:
- I don't think people-pleasing is a strictly bad thing, despite its negative connotation. In fact, I'd argue that the world would be a better place if everyone were as attuned to it as I am. But I'd rather meet the world where it is, than wait for the world to meet me where I am.
- This is only tangentially related, but I've been thinking about my tendency to  awkward silences so much. I think part of the reason is that I don't like the idea of someone else feeling as uncomfortable as I do, and so I tend to fill the void by 



## On solo travel and the empathy gap

Consider the following three time snapshots:
- *Before the trip*. I had never traveled solo for an extended period of time, and was super excited about the idea of it. For the first few days, it was bliss! I designed my own travel itinerary, kept my Airbnb as messy as I wanted, and spent nice meals actually focusing on the food rather than the conversation. 
- *During the trip*. Traveling solo became less great. I began to miss having someone to share travel stress, funny stories, and fancy hotels with. Cities began to blur together, and I realized that I don't intrinsically find most touristy attractions interesting. By week two, I found myself entertaining the idea of poaching a friend to join me for the back half of the trip, though I didn't end up following through with that idea.
- *After the trip*. A few weeks after the trip ended, I've already forgotten many of the specific gripes I had with solo travel and convinced myself that it wasn't that bad. I'm already thinking about planning my next solo trip!

Note how hard it is for me to predict or recall what my feelings in a given state will be, when I'm in a different emotional state! I _know_ that I didn't really enjoy traveling solo that much (at least in cities), but despite that, I can't help but be excited about the prospect of traveling solo again. The empathy gap [https://www.npr.org/2019/11/27/783495595/in-the-heat-of-the-moment-how-intense-emotions-transform-us] is real! 

## On trip planning and keeping too many doors open

I've never been much of a planner on vacations. Usually, I book the high-level logistics (flights, housing) ahead of time, but don't plan much beyond that. For this trip, I tried an even more hands-off approach: before the trip, I booked a one-way flight to Canada and lodging for only a few nights. The rest, I decided to play by ear. If I found myself loving a place, I'd extend my stay for a few more nights. Conversely, if I found myself itching for a change of scenery, I'd pivot quickly. I hypothesized that by providing myself this extra flexibility, I'd be maximizing my enjoyment on the trip by only spending time in places I wanted to, and was mentally prepared for the extra hit to my pocketbook.   

Unfortunately, I soon found my idealistic vision bogged down by the realities of last-minute travel; thinning flight and lodging options actually made my travel plans _less_ liquid than normal. Furthermore, during my supposedly carefree time exploring Toronto, my headspace was haunted by the specter of needing to get home so I could nail down my travel logistics. Before long, I realized the error of my ways, and booked plans for (most of) the remainder of the trip in a single night. I enjoyed the trip significantly more after that.
