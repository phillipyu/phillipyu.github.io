<h2>Hi there! I'm Phillip.</h2>
<p>
  Currently, I'm a full-stack software engineer at
  <a href="https://asana.com">Asana</a> in NYC, where I work on our Goals
  product. Previously, I graduated from
  <a href="https://harvard.edu">Harvard</a> in 2019 and interned at
  <a href="https://biogen.com">Biogen</a> and
  <a href="https://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.
</p>

Recently, I've been:
<ul>
  <li>🇨🇳 Improving my Chinese</li>
  <li>🎾 Working on my tennis serve</li>
  <li>🍳 Exploring NYC's food scene</li>
  <li>🎮 Getting every character into Elite Smash</li>
</ul>

This website is an opportunity for me to write random stuff and explore side
projects. Poke around and drop me a note if you'd like!
